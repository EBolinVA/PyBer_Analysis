# Module 5 | Assignment - PyBer

## Overview of the analysis
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library. Given two files of ride-sharing data: city_data comprised of city name, # of drivers, and city type, and ride_data comprised of city name, date, fare and ride id, the two files were merged and analysis performed to determine the types of cities with the greatest amount of fares and the types of cities where the most rides occured per week.

## Results
Analysis of the data showed that more rides occurred in urban areas in 2019. The average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. The number of rides in each city type is shown in the box plot below:

It follows that with more demand for rides, there are more drivers in the urban areas:

Average fares for riders in rural areas is as much as $11 higher than urban areas, and about $5 higher than suburban areas.

However, we know from the Ride Count Data (2019) chart above that there is simply more demand for rides in urban areas. Even with lower average fares than suburban and rural city types, urban areas bring in more revenue for Pyber.
