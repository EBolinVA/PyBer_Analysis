# Module 5 | Assignment - PyBer

## Overview of the analysis
Analyze and visualize ride-sharing data using Python, Pandas, and the Matplotlib library. Given two files of ride-sharing data: city_data comprised of city name, # of drivers, and city type, and ride_data comprised of city name, date, fare and ride id, the two files were merged and analysis performed to determine the types of cities with the greatest amount of fares and the types of cities where the most rides occured per week.
